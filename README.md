# Solar Power Estimation  

This project analyzes environmental measurements to provide insights for optimizing solar power generation. The analysis focuses on trends in solar radiation, temperature, wind dynamics, and other factors to identify high-potential regions for solar installations.  

## **Features**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on solar radiation and environmental factors.  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle anomalies and outliers.  
- Time series and correlation analysis to uncover key patterns.  
- Wind and temperature impact analysis on solar power efficiency.  

## **Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-power-analytics.git
   cd solar-power-analytics
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
